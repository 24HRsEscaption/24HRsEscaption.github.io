### Project outline

#### NRC Text-to-Speech project outline

Canada is home to about 70 Indigenous languages from 10 different language groups. Fewer than 500 fluent speakers of the majority of these languages remain today, with most of them being old, as a result of the residential school system and other practices of cultural suppression.

In spite of this, Indigenous people have continued to speak their native tongues and defy colonial rules, with parents and students becoming increasingly interested in teaching Indigenous languages. Due to the rise of online learning, many students who did not previously have access to language lessons now do so, which frequently overwhelms teachers. Supporting these expanding student cohorts poses unique difficulties in languages with a dearth of native speakers. Providing pupils with the opportunity to hear the language outside of class is of particular interest to teachers.

While there is no substitute for a native speaker of an Indigenous language, speech synthesis (also known as text-to-speech) has potential applications for enhancing text-based resources like verb conjugators, dictionaries, and phrasebooks.

To cater to the needs, design a web-based user interface to interact with an English text-to-speech model. 

Depending on the input symbols used by the supplied model, user input received via the interface should be translated from plain text to either the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) or Arpabet character tokens (TBD). Each input token will have changeable energy, pitch, and duration due to FastSpeech2's design. The task is to determine the most effective approach to communicate with the model using a web interface that can perform simple text-to-speech synthesis and offer user control over changing the energy, pitch, and length.

### Minutes

#### Week 0
- [Kevin] Create a Github repo with all of us as collaborators:
  - Add Github Id here: kevintab95, karishmavadsaria, 24hrsescaption, ryangawei
  - Add all of this as a Github page
  - Create a Github page that has the following:
- [Karishma] Outline / Introduction of the project (see Aidenâ€™s proposal)
  - User stories (from Canvas discussion)
- [Wenxin] Logistic details like: When we meet? (3 PM Wed), Meeting minutes. That we will use Github for tracking issues.
